## Specs

| Behavior  | Input | Output  |
| :--- | :---: |  :---  |
|1. Create new instance of the Galactic_Age class, passing in user's name and age | Greg, 21 | object.values(greg) = ["Greg", 21]|
|2. Accuratley produce input age in Mercury years, which is about 88 Earth days per solar year, rounded down to nearest whole number.|| greg.mercuryAge = 87|
|3. Accuratley produce input age in Venus years, which is about 225 Earth days per solar year, rounded down to nearest whole number.|| greg.venusAge = 34|
|4. Accuratley produce input age in Mars years, which is about 687 Earth days per solar year, rounded down to nearest whole number.|| greg.marsAge = 11|
|5. Accuratley produce input age in Jupiter years, which is about 4,333 Earth days per solar year, rounded down to nearest whole number.|| greg.jupiterAge = 1|
|6. Add average life expectancy of about 72 years as estimated by the UN in 2019, as expectedLife property to Galactic_Age class constructor||greg.expectedLife = 72|
|7. Check life expectancy against different planet ages and return proper response|greg.mercuryAge|"15 years past life expectancy"|
|8. Allow user to adjust life expectancy property, this will be another adjustment to the existing test for spec #1.|||
